# üè¢ Bulk Import Locations - Instructions

## Overview
You can now bulk import multiple locations at once using a JSON array file instead of adding them one by one through the FireCMS interface.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Using the Standalone Import Tool
1. **Access the Import Tool**: Navigate to `https://sgpros.web.app/import.html` in your browser
2. **Prepare Your Data**: Create a JSON file with your location data (see format below)
3. **Upload & Import**: Select your file, preview the data, and click "Import Locations"

### Option 2: Using FireCMS Interface
1. Open your FireCMS admin panel
2. Go to the Locations collection
3. The offers collection is set up to automatically refresh and pull new data from Firebase

## üìã JSON File Format

Your JSON file should contain an array of location objects. Here's the exact format:

```json

  {
    "slug": "longmont-co",
    "title": {
      "title": "Longmont, Colorado",
